# The-Build-Sheet

This app allows car enthusiasts, like myself, to keep track of the parts and modifications on their cars. You can add parts to the app and label them as Complete, In Progress or To Do. You can even add a note and or a link to the specific part. You can categorize each part you add into the correct caregory and then filter by a specific category (i.e. Drivetrain, Lighting etc.). Once you start or complete a modificatin, you can move it to the In Progress or Completed area. This allows the user to keep track of their parts, both installed and desired, all in one place.
